At the very least, tea is a flavourful way of getting enough fluid into your body each day. On top of that, 
studies have shown teas can help protect your teeth and your heart
<h1>INGREDIENTS</h1>
1.  Tea bag
<p>2.  Water</p>
<p>3.  Milk - Dairy/Plant-based(Optional)
<p>4.  Sugar/Honey(Optional)
<h1>PREPARATION</h1>
1.  Run the tap a little so the water's nicely aerated, and only boil it once to keep the oxygen level up. 
Oxygen in water helps flavour!
<p>2.  Pop a tea bag into your mug (always a big mug)</p>
<p>3.  Pour the hot water over the tea bag and stir briefly.</p>
<p>4.  Tea needs time to unlock all its flavour, so give it 3-4 minutes to do its thing. 
This is a perfect time to grab a sneaky cookie or daydream about vacations.</p>
<p>5.  Before removing the tea bag, gently squish it with a spoon against the side of the mug.
Not too much or you'll make it bitter.</p>
<p>6.  If you want, throw in some milk or sugar or honey or nothing else at all.</p>
<p>7. Enjoy!</p>
